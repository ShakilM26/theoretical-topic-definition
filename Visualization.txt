Visualization is one of the stages of data analysis that helps to
demonstrate the main trends, dependencies, and deviations of indicators
in an informative and interactive way. 


Visualization is a chiefly comprehensible business logic that helps to make correct 
management decisions.


First of all, consider the audience — those who will review the data. Most
often these are company directors, department and subdivision
supervisors, stakeholders, investors, and so on


A visualization method also depends on its purpose


dashboard visualization is suited for
quick comprehension, and as such, it should have minimal information so
a supervisor can quickly understand the data.
