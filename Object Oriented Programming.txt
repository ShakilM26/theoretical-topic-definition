Object: An object is a class instance that allows programmers to use variables 
and methods from inside the class.

Class: A class is a blueprint for declaring and creating objects.


4 OOP concepts.
1. Polymorphism
2. Inheritance
3. Encapsulation
4. Abstraction

Polymorphism: 
Polymorphism is the ability to exist in many forms. Like a student can be a good player, a writer.

Inheritance:
Inheritance means it allows classes to inherit common properties from the parent class. Like a child can inherit some things from his father.

Encapsulation:
Encapsulation means it binds data and code together into one unit.
Like Govt. can binds sales dept, accounts dept, purchase and production dept.

Abstraction:
In Abstraction, it displays only the important information by hiding the implementation part.
