Sentiment analysis is a process of NLP that can identify whether any text type data is positive or negative.
For example, e-commerce companies can find out what customers think about their products, what they like or dislike, what things should be developed.

In today's social media era, people share their feelings, emotions, opinions, product likes, dislikes or pros and cons in the form of text.
