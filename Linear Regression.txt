
Linear Regression is a regression model that uses a straight line to describe the relationship between variables.

Why we need this ? 
It finds the line of best fit through your data by searching for the value of the regression coefficient/s that minimizes the total error of the model.

2 main types of linear regression we know.
* simple linear reg: uses only one independent variable
* multiple linear reg: uses two or more independent variable
